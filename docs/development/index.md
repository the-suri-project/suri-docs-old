# Getting started

The **Suri Project** is built on top of a Solana program and some off-chain services that power its capabilities. As an
infrastructure project, devs need a way to interact with it in a simple and easy way.

Because of this we will provide some SDKs to interact with the program on-chain and off-chain and some APIs to easily
integrate with web2 services or non-blockchain related projects.

::: warning Phase 2
More info will be available in the Phase 2 of the Suri Project.
