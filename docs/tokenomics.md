# Tokenomics

> In short, **there are no tokenomics**

**Suri** is an infrastructure project which implements a subscription model for children suris to pay their parents.
Since **Suri Project** has ownership of the **root** suri domain `.` and some of the most common top level suris, the
revenue for the project will be obtained from the subscription fees coming from their children.

This operational model allows the project not to depend on third-party financial support. It also prevents the project
from the need to have a token-based economy.

## NFTs

Suris are graphically reflected as NFTs, thus the ownership of a suri is represented by the ownership of the associated
NFT. Hence, NFTs are merely a means to an end, a simple and graphic way for owners to interact with the **Suri**
ecosystem.

::: note Insight
Active NFTs will carry the value of the suri it represents. On the contrary, expired NFTs have no value other than the
one people wants to allow them to have.

## Governance Token

**Suri** will become a DAO (_Decentralized Autonomous Organization_) in the future in order to truly decentralize
the **Suri** organization. This DAO will probably be ruled by a democratic system using a governance token as vote
weight. Refer to our [roadmap](/en/roadmap#phase-3-real-decentralization) for further information on what's to come.

::: note
The structure of the DAO and all its mechanisms will be agreed together with the **Suri** community. You can join us
on [discord](https://discord.gg/YdutySHbbk) to become a part of the community and join the discussion.
