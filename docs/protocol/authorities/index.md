# Suri authorities and 3rd party management

Each suri's main authority is the NFT owner. The main authority has the right to completely manage its associated
suri, but they can also add delegated authorities with limited permissions to third parties.

These delegated authorities can perform some actions on behalf of the main authority, such as:

- Selling the suri.
- Selling children.
- Manage records.
- Etc.

This opens to great possibilities like granting access for a third party to manage some records, sell children or the
suri itself, etc.
