# What is Suri?

**Suri** stands for _Solana URI_ and is a **Web3 native** infrastructure project. Its primary goal is to provide a
decentralized and powerful _Domain Name Service_ based on Solana's blockchain.

## What is a Domain Name Service?

A [Domain Name Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) allows internet domains to be translated into
addresses, allowing our devices connect with each other and leading users to the domain's content.

So far, _DNS_ is mostly known for its ability to translate Web2 domains
into [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) addresses, as in the example shown below:

```:no-line-numbers
docs.suri.domains
─┬─────────────── 
 └► IP address = 192.168.1.1
```

## Why Suri?

Web2 based DNS service needs a domain under the ownership of [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/) or any other big company
to work. Furthermore, the current DNS standard is limited in its usability, as it can only translate domains into a
constrained and finite set of protocols.

::: note Note
Only authorized customers are allowed to distribute the domain names under their control. Moreover, they can restrict
the access to most of the _Top Level Domains_.
:::

With **Suri**, these limitations are gone, as users will be allowed to use all domain names,
including [Top Level Domains][TLD], without the need to be a notable individual/company.
Moreover, **Suri** supports the [Unicode](https://unicode.org/) standard, therefore you can acquire your domains in your
own language, not restricting to the **ASCII characters** currently used by Web2's DNS.

Asides, thanks to the versatility in Solana's blockchain, the [use cases](/use-cases) of **Suri** will grow
exponentially, as users will be able to register any protocol in their suris, not just the conventional ones.

## Why Solana?

Even though the final release of [Solana](https://solana.com) has not yet arrived, it is already one of the most
promising blockchain networks. It has a great open-source community, low fees and a great performance compared to its
main competitors, like [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/).

Technically wise, Solana is a younger blockchain but it implements new features and technologies which make it a great
choice for any project and specially for **Suri**. With Solana, **Suri** benefits from low fees, rust-based on-chain
programs and a great performance.
