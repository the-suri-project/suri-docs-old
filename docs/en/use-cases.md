# Use cases & Key benefits

**SURI Protocol** will enhance current [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) service to create a new
Web3 standard for the next internet generation.

## User benefits

A list of benefits coming from this infrastructure project is found below:

- **Open Top Level Domains ([TLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain))**: domains with only one level of
  hierarchy (e.g. `suri`, `myName`, ...) will be open to anyone to register. This will allow for a more open and
  decentralized internet.

- **Decentralized, unrestricted suris**: no domains will be banned or limited in its use, and ownership will be
  available to all users.

- **Global suris**: not geographically limited. Forget about asking for permission to use a domain name.

- **Children management**: parents have the rights to manage his children, no one else will decide for you unless you
  want to approve an [authority](/en/protocol/authorities/).

- **All your content in your suri**: under a single suri, an owner can [register](/en/protocol/records/) different
  data with multiple purposes (website links, social media profiles, crypto wallets, etc.). This will lead to build
  _Digital Identity Services_ over the protocol.
