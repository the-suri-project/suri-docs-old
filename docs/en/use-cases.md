# Use cases & Key benefits

**SURI Protocol** will enhance current [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) service to create a new
Web3 standard for the next internet generation.

## User benefits

A list of benefits coming from this infrastructure project is found below:

- **Open Top Level Domains ([TLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain))**: domains with only one level of
  hierarchy (e.g. `suri`, `myName`, ...) will be open to anyone to register. This will allow for a more open and
  decentralized internet.

- **Decentralized, unrestricted suris**: no domains will be banned or limited in its use, and ownership will be
  available to all users.

  ::: info Insight
  Our politic is to not ban any domain **BUT** we will protect brands, remarkable users, etc. for bad uses of their
  names. Moreover, we will reserve the right to block TLD suris that are used for illegal purposes.
  :::

- **Global suris**: not geographically limited. Forget about asking for permission to use a domain name.

- **Children management**: parents have the rights to manage his children, no one else will decide for you unless you
  want to approve an [authority](/en/protocol/authorities/).

- **All your content in your suri**: under a single suri, an owner can [register](/en/protocol/records/) different
  data with multiple purposes (website links, social media profiles, crypto wallets, etc.). This will lead to build
  _Digital Identity Services_ over the protocol.

## Technical improvements

The **SURI Protocol** is an on-chain version of the [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) protocol
used to navigate the internet. Of course, it is not just a replacement, it is a greatly improved version. Some of its
characteristics will be:

- **Decentralized**: the protocol will be fully working on-chain, so there will not be a central authority (say bye to
  IEEE). Moreover, each parent will have the rights to manage its direct children.

- **Subscription payment**: suris will pay their parents in order to keep active using a subscription payment.

- **Any protocol support**: DNS only supports some standard protocols, like IPv4 (register A), IPv6 (register AAAA),
  etc. On the other side, the **SURI Protocol** will support some built-in protocols but anyone can add support for any
  other protocol at any moment without restrictions.

  This leads to map suris to wallets in any chain, websites, social or private information, etc. allowing using suris as
  an identity service.

- **Full routing**: forget about proxys. The **SURI Protocol** resolution mechanism will allow to route people
  to different services on different ports of the same machine without having to relay on a reverse proxy.

- **Load balancing**: the protocol will have built-in support for some balancing algorithms to distribute the load
  between different servers, so you don't need to pay expensive services for that matter.

## Use cases

- **Identity service**: suris will be able to store any kind of information. This, together with cryptography will give
  users the ability to store private information on-chain that can be verified by anyone using algorithms like
  [ZK-proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof).

- **Branding**: users will be able to use [TLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) suris like `myBrandName`
  or `@username` for their personal or professional identities so people will not need to remember if they are `.com`
  , `.org` ..., they will just need to remember the name of their favorite brands or friends.

- **Global social information**: users can add their social information to their suris, so anyone can see it, including
  social networks. This can be useful to update your public name, description or profile picture in all the networks at
  the same time, just updating your suri.

- **On-chain authorization**: websites, social networks or any service can integrate with the **SURI Protocol** to allow
  their users to sing up in their systems with users' suris. Those services can include some information in the suri
  to define that the user is authorized to use their systems, so only providing ownership of the suri will be enough to
  log in again.

- **Service load balancer**: because of the built-in support for balancing algorithms, users will be able to set their
  services behind a suri instead of paying expensive services.

- **Serve multiple websites on the same machine**: currently we need to use reverse proxies to serve multiple websites
  on the same machine. With the **SURI Protocol** this will be possible without the need of a reverse proxy.

  ::: info Insight
  This feature will not be limited to websites but will be working for any protocol/service.
  :::

- **Subscription models**: companies can deploy their subscription models giving their users a sub suri (e.g.
  `111.subs.netflix`) charging them for their services using the built-in subscription model. As soon as the user stops
  paying or the suri expires, it gets reflected in the service access.

These ideas are just only the beginning, people are free to use and build over the **SURI Protocol** any way they want.
