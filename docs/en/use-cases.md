# Use cases & Key benefits

**SUNS Protocol** will enhance current [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) service to create a new
standard for developments made in Web3: the next internet generation.

## User benefits

A list of benefits coming from this infrastructure project is found below:

- **Open Top Level Domains ([TLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain))**: domains with only one level of
  hierarchy (e.g. `suri`, `myName`, ...) will be open to anyone to register. This will allow for a more open and
  decentralized internet.

- **Decentralized, unrestricted suris**: no domains will be banned or limited in its use, and ownership will be
  available to all users.

  ::: info Insight
  Our policy is not to ban any domain **BUT**, recognised brands will be protected, as well as noteworthy users, etc.
  against bad uses of their names. Moreover, we will reserve the right to block TLD suris that are used for illegal
  purposes.
  :::

- **Global suris**: not geographically limited. Forget about asking for permission to use a domain name.

- **Children management**: parents have the rights to manage his children, no one else will decide for you unless you
  want to approve an [authority](/en/protocol/authorities/).

- **All your content in your suri**: under a single suri, an owner can [register](/en/protocol/records/) different
  data with multiple purposes (website links, social media profiles, crypto wallets, etc.). This will enable users to
  build _Digital Identity Services_ over the protocol.

## Technical improvements

**SUNS Protocol** is an on-chain version of the [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) protocol
used to navigate the internet. Of course, it is not just a replacement, it is a greatly improved version. Some of its
main features will be:

- **Decentralized**: the protocol will be working fully on-chain, so there will be no central authority (say goodbye to
  IEEE). Moreover, each parent will have the rights to manage its direct children.

- **Subscription-based model**: suris will pay their parents in order to keep active using a subscription payment.

- **Enhanced protocol support**: DNS only supports some standard protocols, like IPv4 (register A), Email (register MX),
  etc. On the other side, the **SUNS Protocol** will support some built-in protocols but anyone can add support for
  any other protocol at any moment without restrictions.

  This allows suris be mapped to wallets in any chain, websites, social or any other source of private information, etc.
  hence enabling the use of suris as an identity service.

- **Full routing**: forget about proxys. **SUNS Protocol**'s resolution algorithm will allow the routing
  to different services on different ports of the same machine without having to relay on a reverse proxy.

- **Load balancing**: the protocol will have built-in support for some balancing algorithms to distribute the load
  between different servers. Preventing the need to pay expensive services for that matter.

## Use cases

- **Identity service**: suris will be able to store any kind of information. This, together with cryptography will give
  users the ability to store private information on-chain that can be verified by anyone using algorithms like
  [ZK-proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof).

- **Branding**: users will be able to use [TLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) suris like `myBrandName`
  or `@username` for their personal or professional identities so their customers and providers, friends or relatives,
  or whoever wants to reach out to them will not need to remember whether their domain is `.com`, `.org` or whichever of
  the many existing country domains. Instead, they will just need to remember the **name**. Emphasizing on what's really
  important, and forgetting about senseless and useless endings to domains.

::: info Insight
Imagine a company named "Fake Company, LTD", which is present in multiple countries including UK, USA and Australia.
Instead of needing domains `fakecompany.co.uk`, `fakecompany.us`, `fakecompany.au`, they will only need the
**suri** `fakecompany`
:::

- **Global social information**: just by updating their suris, users can update their corporate identity or social media
  identity.

- **On-chain authorization**: websites, social networks or any service can integrate with the **SUNS Protocol** to allow
  their users to sign up in their systems with users' suris. Those services can include some information in the suri
  to define that the user is authorized to use their systems, so only providing ownership of the suri will be enough to
  log in again.

- **Service load balancer**: thanks to the built-in support for balancing algorithms, users will be able to set their
  services behind a suri instead of paying expensive services.

- **Serve multiple websites on the same machine**: currently we need to use reverse proxies to serve multiple websites
  on the same machine. With the **SUNS Protocol** this will be possible without the need of a reverse proxy.

  ::: info Insight
  This feature will not be limited to websites but will be working for any protocol/service.
  :::

- **Subscription models**: companies can deploy subscription models giving their users a sub suri (e.g.
  `111.subs.netflix`) to charge them for their services using the built-in subscription model. As soon as the user stops
  paying or the suri expires, the subscription is considered ended, and this can be reflected by a limitation to access
  to the service behind it.

These ideas are just only the beginning, people are free to use and build over **SUNS Protocol** any way they want.
