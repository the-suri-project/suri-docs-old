# Use cases & Key benefits 

**SURI Protocol** will enhance DNS service to the meet Web 3.0 standards. A list of benefits coming from this infrastructure project is found below:
-	A decentralized, unrestricted DNS domain: No domains will be banned or limited in its use, and ownership will be available to all users
-	Global domains, not geographically limited: 

-	One SURI for one user's content: Under a single domain, an owner can register different addresses with multiple purposes (website links, social media profiles, crypto wallets, etc.).
-	One domain name linking to several registers (multiple websites and others)
