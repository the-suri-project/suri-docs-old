# Suri Domains

Suri domains are a hierarchy of names that works like a tree similarly to DNS. The root of the tree is the suri root
domain `.` and each parent can have multiple children.

```
                    .
             ┌──────┴────────┐
           com.           domains.
     ┌──────┘        ┌───────┴─────────┐
solana.com.    suri.domains.     other.domains.
```

Suri domains can be used to represent an entity in the Web3 internet, e.g. a user, a project, a collection, a website,
in the end, anything you can think of.
