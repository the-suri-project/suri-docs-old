# Overview: the project

**Suri** is meant to be an infrastructure project that gives users the necessary tools to create fully-native Web3
services being the **foundation** for all the projects built on top.

::: info Insight
At its core activity, **Suri** will manage the root level of all suri domains ([Top Level Domains][TLD] in Web2). Users
will be able to buy these suris for their own use or for resale.
:::

**Suri** will provide a **Smart Contract** on Solana as a groundwork for all owners who buy domains to set their own
sale conditions for their children (allowed names, allowance period, resellability, payment model, ...).

Owners can verify the claim to the domains they hold with a [NFT](/en/domains/nfts), which will be granted during the
buying process.

::: info Insight
This is the only purpose for the NFTs whose values will be that of the suri domain behind it.
