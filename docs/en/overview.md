# Overview: the project

**SURI Protocol** is meant as an infrastructure, as ``foundation to web 3.0 services`` to be built on top. 


::: info Insight
At its core activity, **SURI** will manage the root level for all domain names (Top Level Domains). Users will be able to buy these TLD for their own use or for resale.
:::
 

**SURI** will provide a **Smart Contract** as a groundwork for all owners who buy domains to set their own sale conditions (allowance period, resellability, << añadir más >>…). 

Owners can verify the claim to the domains they hold with a `SURI NFT`, which will be granted during the buying process. 

::: info Note
This is the only purpose for SURI NFTs. This is an infrastructure project and the value of SURI NFTs will be that of the SURI domain behind it.
