# Roadmap

The **Suri Project** has been divided into 3 initial phases and one last that we call [what will come](#what-will-come).
Here you will find the explanations of each:

## Phase 1 - Bookings

The first phase is meant to test the viability of the project and to validate the initial assumptions made during
the development.

For that we have designed a [booking](https://suri.domains/bookings) system that will allow people to book one or more
of their favorite suris giving us some initial statistics and feedback about how the system works, scalability,
etc. apart from receiving initial feedback from the community.

Moreover, during this phase we will be developing the on-chain program, the different SDKs to interact with it,
a UI to manage the suris, etc. and we also be growing our community.

## Phase 2 - The SUNS protocol

When the second phase starts, we will release the SDKs, the on-chain program, etc. as open source projects on GitHub as
well as this [documentation](https://github.com/treviware/suri-docs) is now.

People will be using and testing each part of the code, so we will be able to fix any bugs that appear at that moment
and improve the system with the feedback of the community.

## Phase 3 - Real decentralization

After some time of stabilization, we will start with the third phase, which will be the real decentralization
of the project. It will consist on creating a DAO (_Decentralized Autonomous Organization_) to manage the next steps of
the **Suri Project**.

The governance of the DAO would be supported in a custom SPL token or a NFT collection, but we will discuss with the
community how to do it the better way in order to give that method all the necessary legal support.

## What will come

Finally, when the governance method is ready, we, as a community, will decide what to do next with the project. Our
ideas are the following, but the community will decide:

- Make a new browser to navigate through the web3 internet as the default option and web2 as fallback.
- Make a disruptive version of web languages JS/HTML/CSS, ignoring the retro-compatibility with web2.
- Make a disruptive version of other high level protocols like HTTP, ignoring the retro-compatibility with web2.
- etc.

After reading the proposals, you maybe be asking yourself: **why being so disruptive and changing everything?**

We think that the technology must be retro-compatible for better adoption and support, but we also think that from time
to time we need to be disruptive to let it improve beyond the limits. Current technologies were designed long ago and
most of them were not though to be used the way we use them today, so they lack capabilities or they are very complex
for simple tasks.

We are now living a great revolution with the Web3 in which people like changes, so there is no better time to do it
than now.
