# Authorities

The suris' main authorities are the NFT owners. The main authority has the right to completely manage its associated
suri, but they can also add delegated authorities with limited permissions to third parties.

These delegated authorities can perform some actions on behalf of the main authority, such as:

- Selling the suri.
- Selling children.
- Manage records.
- Etc.

This opens great possibles like granting access to your company's system, in order for them to manage some records that
can authorized yourself in its systems and can be automatically managed by them.
