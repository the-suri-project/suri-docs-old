# Suri Records

Suri records are the minimum source of information of a suri. Each record contains
a [protocol stack](/en/protocol/records/protocols/). The protocol stack itself stores the necessary data to resolve the
suri for a specific protocol(s) and get their value.

All records are stored on-chain, can be accessed by anyone and are managed by its suri's owner.
