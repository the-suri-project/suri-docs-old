# SURI Protocol

The **SURI Protocol** is an on-chain program in Solana that allows users to
claim [suris](http://localhost:5173/en/domains/).
It is a decentralized alternative to the current DNS system, which is controlled by a few big companies.

The protocol stores on-chain the suris' information, their configuration, how to [pay](/en/protocol/subscription)
their parents, their [records](/en/protocol/records/), etc. The program also offers an interface to interact with the
suris so people can buy or sell them, configure them, etc. directly on-chain.

The protocol defines a set of off-chain rules to interact with suris and resolve them. These rules are explained in
the [**Search algorithm**](/en/protocol/searching/) section.
