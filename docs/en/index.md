# About SURI Protocol

`SURI (Solana URI)` is a **Web 3.0 native** infrastructure project. Its primary goal is to provide a decentralized and powerful Domain Name Service based on Solana’s blockchain.

#### What is a Domain Name Service?

A ``Domain Name Service (DNS)`` allows internet domains to be translated into an address that is recognized and can link to the user’s content. So far, **DNS** is mostly known for it’s ability to translate a web domain into an IP Address, as in the example shown below:

```
docs.suri.domains
─┬── 
 └► IP address = 192.168.1.1
```

## Why SURI?

Web 2.0 based DNS service needs a domain under the ownership of `IEEE` to work. Furthermore, the current DNS standard is limited in its usability, as it can only translate certain domains into a constrained and finite set of addresses or results.

::: info Note
Only authorized IEEE customers are allowed to distribute the domain names under their control. And, sometimes, certain domain names remain restricted.
:::



With **SURI**, these limitations are gone, as users will be allowed to use all domain names, without the need to be a notable individual, and all names with **ASCII characters** will be available to use. 

Asides, thanks to the versatility in Solana’s blockchain, the [Use cases](https://docs.suri.domains/en/applications). of the DNS service will grow exponentially, as users will be able to link several addresses under a single domain name

```
Use cases include addressing to social network profiles, crypto
wallet addresses, website addresses, and more.
