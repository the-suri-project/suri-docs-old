# What is Suri?

**Suri** stands for _Solana URI_ and is a **Web3 native** infrastructure project. Its primary goal is to provide a
decentralized and powerful _Domain Name Service_ based on Solana's blockchain.

#### What is a Domain Name Service?

A [Domain Name Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) allows internet domains to be translated into
addresses, allowing our devices connect with each other and leading users to the domain's content.

So far, _DNS_ is mostly known for its ability to translate Web2 domains
into [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) addresses, as in the example shown below:

```
docs.suri.domains
─┬─────────────── 
 └► IP address = 192.168.1.1
```

## Why SURI?

Web2 based DNS service needs a domain under the ownership of [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) to work. Furthermore, the
current DNS standard is limited in its usability, as it can only translate domains into a constrained and finite
set of protocols.

::: info Note
Only authorized IEEE customers are allowed to distribute the domain names under their control. Moreover, they restrict
the access to most of the _Top Level Domains_.
:::

With **Suri**, these limitations are gone, as users will be allowed to use all domain names,
including [Top Level Domains][TLD], without the need to be a notable individual/company.
Moreover, **Suri** supports the [Unicode](https://unicode.org/) standard, therefore you can acquire your domains in your
own language, not restricting to the **ASCII characters** currently used by Web2's DNS.

Asides, thanks to the versatility in Solana's blockchain, the [use cases](https://docs.suri.domains/en/applications)
of **Suri** will grow exponentially, as users will be able to register any protocol in their suris, not just the
conventional ones.

## Why Solana?

Despite being still in beta, [Solana](https://solana.com) is one of the most promising blockchains. It has a great
open-source community, low fees and a great performance compared to its main competitors, like Ethereum.

Technically, Solana is a younger blockchain but implements new technologies that make it a great choice for any project
and specially for **Suri**. Low fees, Rust-based on-chain programs and a great performance are some reasons why **Suri**
is built on top of Solana.
