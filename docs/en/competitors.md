# Competitors

Below is a list of **Suri**'s acknowledged competitors.

## Bonfida

[Bonfida](https://naming.bonfida.org/) is considered **Suri**'s main competitor. It is also based on Solana's
blockchain, but it is more limited in its capabilities and development-ability, as **Bonfida** is not currently going
beyond the current Web2's [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) features in the way the Web3 deserves.

The main similarities and differences are:

|                          |    Bonfida    |                       Suri                       |
|--------------------------|:-------------:|:------------------------------------------------:|
| Blockchain               |    Solana     |                      Solana                      |
| Domains                  |  Only `.sol`  |            Any level including [TLDs]            |

| Tagged domains `@myName` |      No       |            [Yes](/en/domains/tagged)             |
| Custom protocol support  | [Limited][*3] | [Fully support](/en/protocol/records/protocols/) |

## ENS - Ethereum Name Service

[ENS](https://ens.domains/) is a decentralized naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. It is famous for
providing access to `.eth` domains. The main advantage of ENS is to be based on ethereum, one of the most used
blockchains, but that comes along with its main drawback, any action on your domain or records implies to pay a great
fee.

The main similarities and differences are:

|                          |                     ENS                      |                       Suri                       |

| Interaction fees         |                     High                     |                    Negligible                    |
| Domains                  | Natively `.eth` and some others based on DNS |            Any level including [TLDs]            |
| Acquiring                |                Single payment                |      [Configurable Subscription model][*2]       |

| Tagged domains `@myName` |                      No                      |            [Yes](/en/domains/tagged)             |
| Custom protocol support  |                [Limited][*5]                 | [Fully support](/en/protocol/records/protocols/) |
