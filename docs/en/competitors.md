# Competitors

Below is a list of **Suri**'s acknowledged competitors.

## Bonfida

[Bonfida](https://naming.bonfida.org/) is considered **SURI Protocol**'s main competitor. It is also based on Solana's
blockchain, but it is more limited in its capabilities and development-ability, as **Bonfida** is not currently going
beyond the current Web2's DNS features.

The main similarities and differences are:

## Why choose SURI?

Instead, **Suri** is a Web 3.0 native project and can approach the entire scope and develop the use cases needed to
become the _foundation_ for the next generation of internet infrastructure.
