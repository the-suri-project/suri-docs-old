# Tokenomics

> In short, **there are no tokenomics**

**Suri** is an infrastructure project that implements a subscription model for children suris to pay their parents. Due
to the **Suri Project** has the ownership of the root suri domain `.` and some of the most common top level suris, the
revenue for the project will come from the subscription fees of their children.

This way allows us to not depend on third-party financial support neither to have a token-based economy.

## NFTs

Suris are reflected in NFTs, thus the ownership of a suri is represented by the ownership of the associated NFT. So NFTs
are merely a means to an end, a simple and graphic way for owners to interact with the **Suri** ecosystem.

::: info Insight
Active NFTs will carry the value of the suri it represents. On the other hand, expired NFTs have no value other than the
one people wants to give them.

## Governance Token

**Suri** will become a DAO (_Decentralized Autonomous Organization_) in the future in order to truly decentralize
the **Suri** organization. This DAO will probably be ruled by a democratic system using a governance token as vote
weight.

::: info
The structure of the DAO and all its mechanisms will be agreed with the **Suri** community. You can join us
on [discord](https://discord.gg/CtzA2kPdA7) to discuss it.
