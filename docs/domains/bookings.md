# Bookings

Until the second phase of the project, suris will not be available for people to operate with them. That's why
in the first phase we have designed a booking system that will allow people to book their preferred suris.

## Booking methods

There are 4 ways of booking a suri without cost (apart from the network fees). These methods will give users a 3-month
discount once the suri is available to be claimed:

- **Twitter username**: with this option users can claim their Twitter username as a _mention_ (tagged suri),
  e.g. `@myUserName` which will correspond to `tag.mention.myUserName` in the canonical format.

- **Web2 domain**: using a DNS proof you can claim any second-level domain you own in the web2, e.g. `mydomain.com`.

- **SNS domain**: users can bring their `.sol` domains from the [SNS](https://naming.bonfida.org/) signing a message
  that proves they own the domain.

- **ENS domain**: users can bring their `.eth` domains from the [ENS](https://ens.domains/) signing a message that
  proves they own the domain.

::: note Note
Have in mind that due to [liberalization of the TLDs](/domains/tld) in **Suri**, domains are writen in the reverse order
regarding DNS, so if you book `mydomain.com`, `mydomain.sol` or `mydomain.eth` you will receive the equivalent
suris `com.mydomain`, `sol.mydomain` and `eth.mydomain`

Apart from the previous options, we also offer the possibility of buying the suri for a year at half of its final
price. This is the only way of choosing custom names during the booking process.

Finally, we will be dropping giveaways during the whole first phase of the project. Stay tuned
in [Discord](https://discord.gg/YdutySHbbk) to participate!

## Partnership program

Other projects or NFT collections can also offer their users the possibility of booking a suri. To do so, they will have
to establish a partnership with us. Once done they will have a time window in which their users can book a suri using
one of previous methods. This guarantees some advantage over other users to get the suris they want.

After some time, all the methods will be open without restrictions to everyone.
