# Bookings

Until the second phase of the project, suris will not be available for people to operate with them. That's why in the
first phase we have designed a booking system that will allow people to reserve their preferred suris and ensure
ownership from the get-go.

## Booking methods

There are 4 ways to book a suri without cost (apart from network fees). These methods will also grant first owners a
***3-month discount*** once the suri is available for use:

- **Twitter username**: with this option users can claim their Twitter username as a _mention_ ([tagged suri]),
  e.g. `@myUserName` which will correspond to `tag.mention.myUserName` in the canonical format.

- **SNS domain**: users can bring their `.sol` domains from [SNS](https://naming.bonfida.org/) signing a message to
  prove ownership. Users will receive a [tagged suri] in the format `◎domainName` which corresponds
  to `tag.sol.myUserName` in the canonical format.

- **ENS domain**: users can bring their `.eth` domains from [ENS](https://ens.domains/) signing a message to prove
  ownership. Users will receive a [tagged suri] in the format `⧫domainName` which corresponds to `tag.eth.myUserName` in
  the canonical format.

- **Web2 domain**: using a DNS proof you can claim any second-level domain you own in the web2, e.g. `mydomain.com`.

  ::: note Note
  Have in mind that due to [liberalization of the TLDs](/domains/tld) in **Suri**, domains are writen in the reverse
  order regarding DNS, so if you book `mydomain.com` you will receive the equivalent suri `com.mydomain`.
  :::

Apart from the previous options, users will also be given the possibility to buy the suri for a year at half of its
final release price (the defined price starting from Phase 2). This is the only way for users to choose custom names
during the booking process.

Finally, we will be dropping giveaways during the whole first phase of the project. Stay tuned on messages in
our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/YdutySHbbk) to participate!

## Partnership program

Other projects or NFT collections can also offer their users the possibility of booking a suri. To do so, they will have
to establish a partnership with us. Once done they will be assigned a unique time window in which their users can book a
suri using one of the previous methods. This guarantees some advantage over other users to get the suris they want.

After some time, all the methods will be open without restrictions to everyone.
