Moreover, they restrict the access to most of the <em>Top Level Domains</em>.</p></div><p>With <strong>Suri</strong>, these limitations are gone, as users will be allowed to use all domain names, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Top Level Domains</a>, without the need to be a notable individual/company. Moreover, <strong>Suri</strong> supports the <a href="https://unicode.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Unicode</a> standard, therefore you can acquire your domains in your own language, not restricting to the <strong>ASCII characters</strong> currently used by Web2&#39;s DNS.</p><p>Asides, thanks to the versatility in Solana&#39;s blockchain, the <a href="https://docs.suri.domains/en/applications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">use cases</a> of <strong>Suri</strong> will grow exponentially, as users will be able to register any protocol in their suris, not just the conventional ones.</p><h2 id="why-solana" tabindex="-1">Why Solana? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-solana" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Despite being still in beta, <a href="https://solana.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Solana</a> is one of the most promising blockchains.

Low fees, Rust-based on-chain programs and a great performance are some reasons why <strong>Suri</strong> is built on top of Solana.</p>`,14),o=[r];function i(l,c,d,h,p,m){return a(),n("div",null,o)}const f=e(s,[["render",i]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
