Here you will find the explanations of each:</p><h2 id="phase-1-bookings" tabindex="-1">Phase 1 - Bookings <a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-1-bookings" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The first phase is meant to test the viability of the project and to validate the initial assumptions made during the development.</p><p>For that we have designed a <a href="https://suri.domains/bookings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">booking</a> system that will allow people to book one or more of their favorite suris giving us some initial statistics and feedback about how the system works, scalability, etc. apart from receiving initial feedback from the community.</p><p>Moreover, during this phase we will be developing the on-chain program, the different SDKs to interact with it, a UI to manage the suris, etc. and we also be growing our community.</p><h2 id="phase-2-the-suns-protocol" tabindex="-1">Phase 2 - The SUNS protocol <a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-2-the-suns-protocol" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>When the second phase starts, we will release the SDKs, the on-chain program, etc. as open source projects on GitHub as well as this <a href="https://github.com/treviware/suri-docs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a> is now.</p><p>People will be using and testing each part of the code, so we will be able to fix any bugs that appear at that moment and improve the system with the feedback of the community.</p><h2 id="phase-3-real-decentralization" tabindex="-1">Phase 3 - Real decentralization <a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-3-real-decentralization" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>After some time of stabilization, we will start with the third phase, which will be the real decentralization of the project. It will consist on creating a DAO (<em>Decentralized Autonomous Organization</em>) to manage the next steps of the <strong>Suri Project</strong>.</p><p>The governance of the DAO would be supported in a custom SPL token or a NFT collection, but we will discuss with the community how to do it the better way in order to give that method all the necessary legal support.</p><h2 id="what-will-come" tabindex="-1">What will come <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-will-come" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Finally, when the governance method is ready, we, as a community, will decide what to do next with the project. Our ideas are the following, but the community will decide:</p><ul><li>Make a new browser to navigate through the web3 internet as the default option and web2 as fallback.</li><li>Make a disruptive version of web languages JS/HTML/CSS, ignoring the retro-compatibility with web2.</li><li>Make a disruptive version of other high level protocols like HTTP, ignoring the retro-compatibility with web2.</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>After reading the proposals, you maybe be asking yourself: <strong>why being so disruptive and changing everything?</strong></p><p>We think that the technology must be retro-compatible for better adoption and support, but we also think that from time to time we need to be disruptive to let it improve beyond the limits. Current technologies were designed long ago and most of them were not though to be used the way we use them today, so they lack capabilities or they are very complex for simple tasks.</p><p>We are now living a great revolution with the Web3 in which people like changes, so there is no better time to do it than now.</p>',18),n=[r];function s(h,l,d,c,p,m){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const g=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
