That&#39;s why in the first phase we have designed a booking system that will allow people to book their preferred suris.</p><h2 id="booking-methods" tabindex="-1">Booking methods <a class="header-anchor" href="#booking-methods" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>There are 4 ways of booking a suri without cost (apart from the network fees). These methods will give users a 3-month discount once the suri is available for use:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Twitter username</strong>: with this option users can claim their Twitter username as a <em>mention</em> (tagged suri), e.g. <code>@myUserName</code>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Web2 domain</strong>: using a DNS proof you can claim any domain you own in the web2, e.g. <code>mydomain.com</code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p><p>Have in mind that you can only claim a second-level domain, e.g. <code>mydomain.com</code> but not <code>subdomain.mydomain.com</code>.</p></div></li><li><p><strong>SNS domain</strong>: users can bring their <code>.sol</code> domains from the <a href="https://naming.bonfida.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SNS</a> signing a message that proves they own the domain.</p></li><li><p><strong>ENS domain</strong>: users can bring their <code>.eth</code> domains from the <a href="https://ens.domains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ENS</a> signing a message that proves they own the domain.</p></li></ul><p>Apart from the previous options, we also offer the possibility of buying the suri for a year at half of its final price. This is the only way of choosing custom names during the booking process.</p><p>Finally, we will be dropping giveaways during the whole first phase of the project. Stay tuned in <a href="https://discord.gg/CtzA2kPdA7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Discord</a> to participate!</p><h2 id="partnership-program" tabindex="-1">Partnership program <a class="header-anchor" href="#partnership-program" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Other projects or NFT collections can also offer their users the possibility of booking a suri. To do so, they will have to establish a partnership with us. Once done they will have a time window in which their users can book a suri using one of previous methods. This guarantees some advantage over other users to get the suris they want.</p><p>After some time, all the methods will be available for everyone.</p><p>If you are interested in this option, please contact us at <a href="https://discord.gg/CtzA2kPdA7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Discord</a>.</p>',11),s=[r];function n(h,d,l,p,c,m){return o(),t("div",null,s)}const f=e(i,[["render",n]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
