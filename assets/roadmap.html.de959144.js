Here you will find the explanations of each:</p><h2 id="phase-1-bookings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-1-bookings" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Phase 1 - Bookings</h2><p>The first phase is meant to test the viability of the project and to validate the initial assumptions made during the development.</p><p>For that we have designed a booking system that will allow people to book one or more of their favorite suris giving us some initial statistics and feedback about how the system works, scalability, etc. apart from receiving initial feedback from the community.</p><p>Moreover, during this phase we will be developing the on-chain program, the different SDKs to interact with it, a UI to manage the suris, etc. and we also be growing our community.</p><h2 id="phase-2-suns-protocol" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-2-suns-protocol" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Phase 2 - SUNS protocol</h2>',7),d={href:"https://github.com/treviware/suri-docs",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},p=a('<p>People will be using and testing each part of the code, so we will be able to fix any bugs that appear at that moment and improve the system with the community&#39;s feedback.</p><h2 id="phase-3-web3-browser" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-3-web3-browser" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Phase 3 - Web3 Browser</h2><p>After some time of stabilization, we will release a first version of a customized web browser that allows people to navigate through web3 using <strong>Suri</strong>. This will allow us to reach a wider audience and to show how to develop applications over <strong>Suri</strong>.</p><p>During this phase we will encourage the community to build apps over <strong>Suri</strong> preparing tutorials and examples.</p><h2 id="phase-4-real-decentralization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-4-real-decentralization" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Phase 4 - Real decentralization</h2><p>Finally, we will start with the last phase, which will be the real decentralization of the project. It will consist on creating a DAO (<em>Decentralized Autonomous Organization</em>) to manage the next steps of the <strong>Suri Project</strong>.</p><p>The governance of the DAO would be supported in a custom SPL token or a NFT collection, but we will discuss with the community how to do it the better way in order to give that method all the necessary legal support.</p><h2 id="what-will-come" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-will-come" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What will come</h2><p>Finally, when the governance method is ready, we, as a community, will decide what to do next with the project. Here are some of our ideas, but again, the community will decide:</p><ul><li>Develop a new browser to navigate through the web3 internet as the default option and web2 as fallback.</li><li>Develop a disruptive version of web languages JS/HTML/CSS, ignoring backward compatibility with web2.</li><li>Develop a disruptive version of other high level protocols like HTTP, ignoring the retro-compatibility with web2.</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>After reading the proposals, you maybe be asking yourself: <strong>why being so disruptive? Why the need to change everything?</strong></p><p>We believe that technology must have backward compatibility for better adoption and support, but we also think that every now and then, we must let disruptive technologies arise, so we can improve and expand beyond the existing technologies&#39; limitations. Current technologies were designed in early 21st century, and most of them were not though to be used the way they are employed today, and hence they lack capabilities or have become very complex for simple tasks.</p><p>With Web3, we are now living a great revolution, so we strongly believe there is no better time to leave behind obsolete technologies than now. We must let internet technologies evolve, and we believe <strong>SURI</strong> can lay the foundations for the upcoming change of paradigm</p>',13);function w(u,m){const o=h("ExternalLinkIcon");return n(),r("div",null,[c,t("p",null,[e("When the second phase starts, we will release the SDKs, the on-chain program, etc. as open source projects on GitHub as well as this "),t("a",d,[e("documentation"),s(o)]),e(" is now.")]),p])}const b=i(l,[["render",w],["__file","roadmap.html.vue"]]);export{b as default};
