They are unique, non-fungible, and can be transferred from one owner to another. They are also greatly well integrated in the Solana ecosystem:</p><ul><li>Anyone can see the suris they own by simply looking at the NFT section of their wallets.</li><li>They can be transferred from one owner to another by simply sending the NFT.</li><li>They can be listed and sold on any Solana marketplace.</li><li>They can be used in DeFi applications, auctions, raffles, etc.</li><li>...</li></ul><p>Using NFTs makes the <strong>Suri Project</strong> be very well integrated with the ecosystem from the beginning.</p><h2 id="edge-cases" tabindex="-1">Edge cases <a class="header-anchor" href="#edge-cases" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The NFT mapping is not perfect. For example, if a suri expires, the NFT will still be owned by the previous owner. As you probably already know, once someone owns an SPL token no one can take it away from them, so we cannot get back the NFT from the previous user.</p><p>To work around this problem, the off-chain NFT service will check for edge cases, like suri expiration, lack of funds, in-program sales, etc. and will update the minting information of the NFT according to the new status.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Insight</p><p>Once a suri is expired, the NFT will become useless, so it is recommended to burn it to cleanup your wallets and recover some funds.</p></div><h3 id="security" tabindex="-1">Security <a class="header-anchor" href="#security" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>There is a time between the moment a suri reaches one of those edge cases and the moment the NFT service detects it and updates the NFT. During this time, the NFT shows the previous state of the suri, which can be misleading.</p><p>To avoid derived problems, like scamming, selling expired NFTs, etc. users will need to make sure the <em>SVC</em> (Suri Verification Code) showed in the NFT match with the real one present in the blockchain if they want to make sure the suri is in the right state.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Insight</p><p>We will offer a service at <a href="https://suri.domains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">suri.domains</a> to verify the SVC of a suri.</p></div><h2 id="children-customization" tabindex="-1">Children customization <a class="header-anchor" href="#children-customization" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>NFTs represent the ownership of a suri, but they can also represent their parents so parents will have the ability to include a custom message and picture in their children&#39;s NFTs as a way of making them unique or branded.</p>',17),r=[n];function o(h,l,c,d,u,p){return t(),s("div",null,r)}const g=e(a,[["render",o]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
