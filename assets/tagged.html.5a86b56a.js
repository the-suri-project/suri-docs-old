This is especially useful for suris belonging to users or brands.</p><p>Some examples are:</p><ul><li><p>We want to use a suri as a source of our digital identity, we can use a <em>mention</em> <code>@username</code> and then use subdomains to split the content for our social networks, e.g. <code>@username.twitter</code> <code>@username.facebook</code>, etc. We could have used a [TLD] here like just <code>username</code> but this way we are emphasizing we are a person and not a brand.</p></li><li><p>A Web3 project is minting a new token and exposing its data using a <em>cashtag</em> <code>$MY_TOKEN</code>. They want to store its public information, like where to buy it, the project&#39;s website, etc. in the suri&#39;s records but storing the pricing information in <code>$MY_TOKEN.pricing</code> to separate the concepts, using the suri as a kind of oracle. With the prefix <code>$</code> we have clear that it is a token and not a brand or user.</p></li></ul><p>If instead of using a tagged suri we use a regular suri, we would have ended with <code>username.twitter</code> or <code>MY_TOKEN.pricing</code>, which are perfectly fine but do not emphasize the actual subject of the action.</p><p>You can check the full <a href="/domains/formats#tagged-format">definition</a> and all tagged types in the following section.</p><p>As a final note, bear in mind that thanks to SUNS protocol&#39;s technology (Solana on-chain) users can store their public information as part of a suri, which can then be used to perform simultaneous updates on all social network profiles. This feature is, of course, also included for tagged suris.</p>',9),n=[s];function r(c,d){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const l=e(i,[["render",r],["__file","tagged.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
